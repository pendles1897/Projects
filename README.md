Re: png2jpeg.py

Modify line 4 so that it matches your current working directory. The penultimate folder should be your working directory;
The last folder should be a folder containing only the file you wish to convert to JPEG format. This folder should be
emptied whenever not in use to ensure the smooth operation of this script.
